  ABSTRACT={By matching air quality index (AQI) data with the household data from China Family Panel Studies(CFPS), we identify the impact of air pollution on household medical expenses from a micro perspective. The results show that higher air pollution will increase household medical expenses and change household consumption structure. This effect is still significant after controlling for cities' relevant household and individual characteristics and economic characteristics. Under different educational backgrounds, income, hukou, gender, and other conditions, air pollution will significantly reduce medical spending. For those females in the urban areas with higher education backgrounds and higher income, the spending elasticity of air pollution is more significant than other corresponding groups. And air pollution will promote medical expenses through stronger individuals’ environmental awareness, poor health conditions,bad emotional status, and positive risk aversion. Furthermore, we find that the impact of air pollution on healthcare spending remains significant after instrumental variables regression and geographical regression based on the Qinling Mountains-Huaihe River Line.}

  ABSTRACT = {Objective: The deterioration in environmental quality has an economic and social cost. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of environmental factors on health expenditures in developing countries. Method: To analyze the relationship between environmental quality (air pollution and temperature) and health expenditure in thirty-three developing countries, the study uses system generalized method of moments (GMM) using data from 2000 to 2017. Results: The results suggest a positive effect of both air pollution and temperature on health expenditure. However, the effect is highest for government health expenditure, followed by private and total health expenditure in the studied countries. The results further suggest that the impact of environmental factors is greater in higher-income countries when we divide the studied countries into two groups, i.e., higher- and lower-income countries. Conclusion: Our results are interesting and informative for the policy makers to design such policies to attain better environmental quality and social well-being. The increased healthcare expenditures due to increased air pollution and climate change necessitate for an efficient, reliable, affordable and modern energy policy by emphasizing the use of clean and renewable energy in these countries that ensure better health for the masses. Furthermore, a smart and sustainable environmentally friendly economic growth policy is necessary to ensure better health for the masses.},

Using the China Urban Household Survey (UHS) Database, this paper estimated the effect of air pollution exposure on household healthcare expenditure. To address potential endogeneity concerns, we performed household healthcare expenditure regressions using an instrumental variables (IV) strategy based on spatial air pollution spillovers. Our research revealed that a 1% increase in yearly exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) corresponds to a 2.942% (95% confidence interval: 1.084%, 4.799%) increase in household healthcare expenditure. The estimates suggest that the 13th Five-Year Plan for Ecological and Environmental Protection (the 13th FYP) would reduce annual national healthcare expenditure by 47.36 Billion Dollar (95% confidence interval: 17.45 Billion Dollar, 77.25 Billion Dollar), which accounts for 0.64% (95% confidence interval: 0.24%, 1.04%) of China's gross domestic product (GDP).}

It concludes that exposure to air pollution is associated with the increase in health expenditure with an elasticity of 10.013. The coefficient is roughly seven times bigger than the cost of traditional respiratory diseases. The large coefficient will be the social cost of medical insurance and various diseases. Results also indicate that sample mobility can underestimate health cost. Meanwhile, we identify heterogeneity among different populations and pollutants. The estimates show that PM2.5 is the main cause of health expenditure and that males, high-income individuals, highly educated individuals, people with health insurance, and older people are more sensitive to air pollution. Moreover, our evidence suggests that air pollution nonlinearly affects health expenditure. We also find that the mechanism is through diseases occurrence and diseases severity to increase health expenditure.}

Accounting for the possibility of non-linearity in the data and the relationship among the variables, the analysis estimated various statistical models to demonstrate that CO2 emissions led to increases in health care expenditures across U.S states between 1966 and 2009. Using quantile regressions, the analysis displayed that the effect of CO2 emissions was stronger at the upper-end of the conditional distribution of health care expenditures. Results indicate the effect of CO2 emissions on health care was relatively stronger for states that spend higher amounts in health care expenditures. The primary policy message of the paper is that there can be tangible health related benefits associated with policies that aim to reduce carbon emissions across U.S. states.}

Our empirical analysis is based on eight OECD countries, namely Austria, Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, and the UK for the period 1980–1999. We find that per capita health expenditure, per capita income, carbon monoxide emissions, sulphur oxide emissions and nitrogen oxide emissions are panel cointegrated. While short-run elasticities reveal that income and carbon monoxide emissions exert a statistically significant positive effect on health expenditures, in the long-run in addition to income and carbon monoxide, we find that sulphur oxide emissions have a statistically significant positive impact on health expenditures.}

ABSTRACT = {As a result of China’s economic growth, air pollution, including carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, has caused serious health problems and accompanying heavy economic burdens on healthcare. Therefore, the effect of carbon dioxide emission on healthcare expenditure (HCE) has attracted the interest of many researchers, most of which have adopted traditional empirical methods, such as ordinary least squares (OLS) or quantile regression (QR), to analyze the issue. This paper, however, attempts to introduce Bayesian quantile regression (BQR) to discuss the relationship between carbon dioxide emission and HCE, based on the longitudinal data of 30 provinces in China (2005–2016). It was found that carbon dioxide emission is, indeed, an important factor affecting healthcare expenditure in China, although its influence is not as great as the income variable. It was also revealed that the effect of carbon dioxide emission on HCE at a higher quantile was much smaller, which indicates that most people are not paying sufficient attention to the correlation between air pollution and healthcare. This study also proves the applicability of Bayesian quantile regression and its ability to offer more valuable information, as compared to traditional empirical tools, thus expanding and deepening research capabilities on the topic.},
